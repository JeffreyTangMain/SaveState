This is a fork of Brainstorm that only has the save state feature, to be used with the latest alpha version of Brainstorm that no longer has this feature.

## Features
### Save-States
SaveState has the capability to save up to 9 save-states through the use of in-game key binds. 
> To create a save-state: Hold `z + 1-9`
> To load a save-state:	Hold `x + 1-9`

Each number from 1 - 9 corresponds to a save slot. To overwrite an old save, simply create a new save-state in it's slot.
